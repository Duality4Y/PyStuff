Hi there! I've found something beautiful by accident here,
And though i might show ja :)
somehow it just goes into this acceleration loop :)
the bounderies (borders) are infinite, you go off one side,
you end on the other side.
i generate random properties for every pair of sphere's,
the sphere's follow each other though. atleast that is what it was meant to do,
but sometimes they go in orbit or dos something weird, like halfe way a orbit, just go in the opposite direction,
but this probably is my math :)
lets add more sphere's :)
yea that did not do what i expected to do .. :)
but yea that was it for now ... :)

hi i am back! wanted to show this effect i made :)
enjoy :) alright 500 pairs that was, controlled with a key and mouse :)
i could controle either the left side or right side, with the left or right mousebutton :)
