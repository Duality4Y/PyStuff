Hey :)
same as before, lol key broke nvm that, 
same as before, shoot from player,
change's if you fire and press button to fire again, and bullet
did not hit anything and/or is still underway, it'll not fire another
bullet.
when bullet hit's something, it'll return to the owner :)
also the bullet follows the owner if it's not fired.
let me show you :)
